Diploma project written in full stack JavaScript.

# PEVN software stack

- **P**ostgreSQL
- **E**xpress.js
- **V**ue.js (but most of the HTML is server rendered with Pug)
- **N**ode.js

All of the technologies are open source.

# Frontend

[Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io) components. MDL provides good appearance and responsive design support out of the box. Some custom components were used.

[List.js](http://listjs.com/) for client grid sorting and search.

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to generate DOM on the client. After trying Angular for this role decision was made to minimize client rendering and it was accomplished. Vue is used only on a couple of pages.

[Quill](https://quilljs.com/) rich text editor.

# Backend

PostgreSQL along with [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) ORM library.

[Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) as HTML template engine. It is used almost everywhere to generate HTML on server. 

Check `package.json` for more details about used backend libraries.
